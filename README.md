## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### üîß Step 1: Customize Paths

Edit each script‚Äôs `SOURCE` and `DEST` variables to match your environment:

- `SOURCE`: the folder where your cloud photos are stored locally  
- `DEST`: the folder on your external hard drive where you want them backed up  

### üçè Mac Users

- Use `chmod +x script.sh` to make scripts executable
- You can run via Terminal or use Automator to trigger with a click

### ü™ü Windows Users

- Double-click `.bat` files to run
- Scripts will open a console window and display progress
- Make sure your external drive is assigned the correct drive letter (e.g., `E:`)

## üß† Best Practices

- Always **verify** backups before using the delete versions
- Store your backups in a dated folder structure for easier retrieval
- Review the generated `backup-log.txt` file for audit history

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

- These scripts use `xcopy` (Windows) and `cp` (Mac) to mirror your photo directory  
- Deletion only occurs after a successful copy  
- Still, use at your own risk. Always confirm file transfers manually the first time

## üïí Coming Soon

- Scheduled backup integration (Task Scheduler or `launchd`)
- Support for cloud APIs (Google Takeout, iCloud CLI)
- GUI version
